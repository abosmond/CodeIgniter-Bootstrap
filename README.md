# CodeIgniter-Bootstrap

This is admin template ready for CodeIgniter development. The specification is :
1. CodeIgniter framework version 3.1.4, http://codeigniter.com
2. Integrated with HMVC, https://bitbucket.org/wiredesignz/codeigniter-modular-extensions-hmvc
3. Integrated with ion_auth, http://benedmunds.com/ion_auth/
4. AdminLTE theme, https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE

I also add one user module with CRUD capability ( add user, edit user, delete user, change password ) and login module, of course. You can use my code and edit it by yourself. 
If you have any question, just pull requests or contact me at abosmond86@gmail.com. 

Happy coding,
